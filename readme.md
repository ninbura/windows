# Suggested Prerequisites
- A currently functioning computer running Windows.
- A USB 2.0 flash drive under 32GB in size.
- A USB 3.0 flash drive greater than 8GB in size.
- A Windows 11 Pro For Workstations product key.
    - If you have a business grade microsoft account for work, you may be able to obtain a key for free [here](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=Windows%2011).
    - Otherwise, [this](https://wholsalekeys.com/shop/windows-11-pro-for-workstations/) is a good place to buy cheap keys.

# steps
1. ### Mount the Windows 11 ISO/Installer to a Bootable Flash Drive using Rufus
    - USB 3.0 drive preffered
    - must be greater than 8GB
2. ### Update & Configure Your Motherboard's BIOS
    1. update BIOS via GUI or advanced "Flashback"
       - USB 2.0 flash drive preferred
       - must be smaller than 32GB & formatted as FAT32
    2. configure BIOS
        - enable virtual or physical TPM (usually on by default)
        - verify that secure boot is *enabled and active*

5. ### Update Windows
    - Open the Settings app & navigate to `Windows Updates`.
    - Optionally, toggle "Get the latest updates as soon as they're available"; I personally suggest doing this.
    - Check for updates & wait for them to download/install.
    - Restart your computer.
    - Check for updates again.
    - If you have more updates and pc requests restarting again, do so.
    - Repeat until Windows states that everything is up-to-date.
6. ### Update Microsoft Store Apps
    1. Open the Microsoft Store via your Start Menu.
    2. Click the "library" or "downloads" button (version dependent) in the bottom left hand corner of the window.

          New-Item -Path "~/repos/windows/config.json" -ItemType "File"
          ```
    - Note that `~` represents your user's directory (ie `C:/Users/gabri/`).
    - Open `~/repos/windows/config.json` in desired text editor (ie Notepad).
    - See [bulk edit settings configuration](#bulk-edit-settings-configuration) for instructions as how to configure your `config.json` file.
    - Save and close `config.json`.
    - Right click `~/repos/windows/run-me.bat` & select "Run as administrator".
    - Wait for the script to finish running, then **restart your computer**.
11. ### Manually configure other windows settings

      - enable "public folder sharing"
      - enable "password protected sharing"
    - Configure other system settings you'd like which weren't included in the above list or the `bulk-edit-settings` powershell script.
12. ### download/install system drivers
    - see [drivers](#drivers) list below
    - Note that every driver you need may not be listed below, said list is composed of items relevant to me and my direct peers.
    - you don't need to restart your computer when prompted after every single driver
    - restart your computer after installing all drivers
13. ### UniGetUI - bulk install/update applications
    1. install & open UniGetUI
        - ```PowerShell
          winget install MartiCliment.UniGetUI
          ```
    2. click on "Package BUndles" in the left-hand side menu
    3. Load the `~/repos/windows/unigetui-package-bundles/dependencies.ubundle` bundle, check the box in the header to select all applications, and click "Install Selection".
    4. wait for dependencies to finish installing
    5. load the `~/repos/windows/unigetui-package-bundles/apps.ubundle` bundle, select the apps you'd like to install, and and click "Install Selection".
    6. wait for apps to finish installing
14. ### verify that system temperatures are in-check
    - under construction
    - see [troubleshooting high temperatures](#troubleshooting-high-temperatures) if temps are high
15. ### download/install remaining software
    - see [software](#software) section below
    - just like drivers you don't need to restart your computer when prompted after every single install
    - restart your computer after installing all desired software (if you were prompted at somepoint to do so)
    - Note that every piece of software you want may not have been included in your `apps.ubundle`, and or may not be listed in the [software](#software) section below. Said lists are composed of items relevant to me and my direct peers.
    - software in the section below is software that can not currently be installed properly via winget/UniGetUI
    - It is _always_ preferred you install software with winget/UniGetUI, it's much quicker & UniGetUI will keep your software updated.
    - If software isn't available via winget/UniGetUi, install software the old fashioned way ðŸ˜­
16. ### configure audio settings
    - open control panel & navigate to `hardware & sound > sound`
    - verify you're on the "playback" tab
      - right click any device that you wont be using & select "disable" (repeat for all unused devices)
      - right click any device and uncheck "show disabled devices" (re-enable as needed for troubleshooting and stuff)
      - if you only have one usable/desired output device
        - select desired device & click the "set default" button below the device list
      - if you have a fancy pants audio mixer or what have you with multiple usable output devices
        - right click which audio output you want as your default output device & select "set as default device"
        - right click which audio output you want as your communication device & select "set as default comunication device"
    - click on "recording" tab
      - right click any device that you wont be using & select "disable" (repeat for all unused devices)
      - right click any device and uncheck "show disabled devices" (re-enable as needed for troubleshooting and such)
      - select desired device & click the "set default" button below the device list
    - repeat these steps any time you encounter **_(ðŸ˜”((((audio problems))))ðŸ˜”)_**
17. ### configure rgb lighting
    - this is a very inconsistent process not only by motherboard but often by sepcific components
    - often times your motherboard will have a single piece of software that allows for configuring all rgb
    - other times you need a specific program for a specific component
      - For exmaple, pny gpus use dedicated software, motherboard can't configure many pny gpus lighting.
    - It's really such a mixed bag that you'll just have to start by referencing / installing your motherboards rgb control software, and then work from there.
    - For each component that can't be controlled via this software, google the exact component in question + "rgb control" & pray that you find competent instructions online.

# drivers

### drivers preface

- **Many drivers will need be downloaded from your motherboard's support page**, others are typically universal.
- If your motherboard uses intel drivers for bluetooth, lan (ethernet), & wan (wifi) you can use the links below to get the latest versions.
- To verify that your motherboard uses universal intel drivers, you'll need to go to your motherboards support page.
- Take note of your motherboard's model number, should be listed on the box it came in, or you can use HWiNFO to retreive it.
    - ```PowerShell
      winget install REALiX.HWiNFO
      ```   
- search for your motherboard via it's model number on google & locate the support page

### motherboard specific drivers

- look for the following drivers on your motherboard's support/driver page
- audio drivers
  - usually labeled as realtek
  - only grab latest version, don't need mulitple motherboard audio drivers
- intel chipset drivers (intel cpus only)
  - there may be multiple "chipset" style drivers
  - look for drivers titled as so
    - intel serial i/o
    - intel management engine
    - intel me
    - intel mei
    - intel inf
    - intel hid
  - you should see one or many of the aformentioned intel chipset drivers
- communication drivers
  - If LAN, Wifi, or Bluetooth drivers are listed as Intel, I would suggest using the links below in-favor of the drivers on the Motherboard support page. They are more up to date.
  - drivers
    - bluetooth
    - lan (ethernet / wired internet driver)
    - wan (wifi driver)
- sata drivers
    - typically labeled as "Intel Rapid Storage Technology" or "AMD SATA"

### intel

- check motherboard page to make sure your motherboard uses intel for these devices
- [bluetooth](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005489/wireless.html)
- [lan](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/727998/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-microsoft-windows-11.html)
- [wan](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19351/windows-10-and-windows-11-wi-fi-drivers-for-intel-wireless-adapters.html)
- [graphics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/785597/intel-arc-iris-xe-graphics-windows.html)

### [amd cpu/chipset & gpu](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

- I would uncheck installing amd's powerplan when installing AMD chipset/cpu drivers
- you'll also want to select the "clean install" option when installing AMD gpu drivers.

### [nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)

- _Click buttons on nvidia driver page slowly, if you move too fast you will get ip banned!_
- always select **custom install** and then **clean install**
- open nvidia control panel ([shift+right click] desktop)
  - select "manage 3d settings" in left hand side menu
    - set "power management mode" to "prefer maximum performance"
  - select "change resolution" in left hand side menu & verify that all monitors are
    - set to the correct resolution & refresh rate
    - set to full rgb color mode
    - If color mode is partial and greyed out; override settings with "use nvidia color settings".
- after driver install it's likely that your windows audio settings got borked (see [configure audio settings](#configure-audio-settings) for fix)

### other drivers

- [silabs 3.9.2](https://hdfury.com/product/integral-2/) (hdfury integral 2)
  - must be installed via **admin elevated** terminal
  - `start-process -path [releativepath]/Silabs_Driver_v3/Silabs_Driver_v3/USBXpressInstaller.exe`
- [magewell pro capture](https://www.magewell.com/downloads/pro-capture) (magewell capture pro cards)

# troubleshooting

### troubleshooting bootloop / boot problems

- If computer is bootlooping
  - Re-flash bios using Flashback functionality, note that not every computer has this functionality.
  - See []()
- if computer failed to boot into bios after enabling x.m.p and now you're stuck in "safe mode"
  - try setting ram clock at a lower clock
  - if setting the clock speed lower multiple time fails simply disable x.m.p
  - note that you want your ram to be at the highest possible clock for best performance
  - if ram is a reasonable speed (DDR5 5600-6800Mhz | DDR4 2600-3600) and can't achive x.m.p you should consider returning it for different ram
  - if new ram of similar speed has the same issues you may have a defective cpu or motherboard and will need to replace it

### troubleshooting failed windows activation

- Verify that the product key you entered matches the one you purchased/obtained earlier.
- If the product keys match but Windows still failed to activate you may need to activate by phone.
  - There should be a button to do this via the `system > activation` screen.
  - Follow on-screen instructions.
  - Involves calling a number and answering prompts by voice and or your dial pad.
- I've never had phone activiation fail, but if it did somehow, you may have purchased a key that's already been used and will need to get a new one.

### troubleshooting high temperatures

- if your **_cpu_** temperatures are too high you
  - mounted your cpu cooler incorrectly
    - clean, re-paste, and re-seat the heatsink / water block
  - didn't plug in your fans / fans are defective & not running
  - Have your fan curve misconfigured, causing fans/pumps to not run (see fan curve [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoWlNIzOO0E) | should be similar for most motherboards).
  - used an inadequate cpu cooler
  - have major airflow problems in your case
  - are running your pc in an overly hot environment (90f+)
  - have a motherboard that is misreporting temps (unlikely but happens)
  - have a defective cpu or cpu cooler and need to rma / exchange one or the other
- if your **_gpu_** temperatures are too high
  - verify that gpu fans are spinning
  - verify that nothing is too close to or obstructing gpu fans
  - verify that all other fans in case are working
  - set a more aggressive fan curve via msi afterburner
  - if temps are still too high your gpu's heatsink may have a poor factory mount, at which point you can
    - rma / exchange the gpu
    - clean, re-paste, and re-seat the heatsink ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7NMeu0QiYk))
- if your **_m.2 ssd_** temperatures are too high you
  - didn't properly install your m.2 drive
  - need an aftermarket heatsink for your m.2 drive
  - need to install a fan pointing directly at your m.2 drive
  - have a defective drive and need to rma / exchange it

# bulk-edit-settings configuration

### config.json example

Note that if a setting is ommited from the configuration it will simply skip the logic to set that setting. So, you don't necessarily have to set everything to true or false. If you want to use Windows' default configuration for any given setting, simply omit it from `config.json`.

```json
{
  "Administrative": {
    "DisableUacPopups": true
  },
  "Cursor": {
    "DisableEnhancedPointerPrecision": true,
    "DisableEaseCursorMovement": true
  },
  "FileExplorer": {
    "EnableCompactView": true,
    "MoveRecycleBinToFileExplorer": true,
    "ShowFileExtensionsForKnownFileTypes": true,
    "ShowHiddenFilesAndFolders": true,
    "ShowRecentlyUsedFilesInQuickAccess": false,

}
```

### setting descriptions

- #### administrative
  - `DisableUacPopups` [`true`/`false`] - removes the "are you sure" popup when you doing anything that requires admin privileges
- #### cursor
  - `DisableEnhancedPointerPrecision` [`true`/`false`] - Disables enhanced pointer precision, a must for gaming, but just good in all cases to be honest.
  - `DisableEaseCursorMovement` [`true`/`false`] - Disables "easing" cursor movement between displays. Easing feels super jank imo, it can make your cursor jump to an unnatural place when transitioning through displays.
- #### file explorer
  - `EnableCompactView` [`true`/`false`] - This removes a lot of dead space in file explorer, returning some of the way it looked/felt in windows 10.
  - `MoveRecycleBinToFileExplorer` [`true`/`false`] - This will remove the recycle bin shortcut from your desktop and pin it to the bottom of the left hand side menu of file explorer. It's still very accesible, and this keeps your desktop clean.
  - `ShowFileExtensionsForKnownFileTypes` [`true`/`false`] - This makes it so windows doesn't hide file extensions at the end of file names, super useful to see file extensions in many use cases.
  - `ShowFrequentlyUsedFoldersInQuickAccess` [`true`/`false`] - Supposed to make it so pinned folders show in the File Explorer Home, but kinda it's kind of bugged. May require interaction with the gui to get working properly.
  - `ShowHiddenFilesAndFolders` [`true`/`false`] - prevents windows from hiding files and folders in file explorer
  - `ShowOfficeCloudFilesInQuickAccess` [`true`/`false`] - Make it so Office cloud files show up in the quick access menu within the left hand side menu of file explorer. I like to to disable this.
  - `ShowRecentlyUsedFilesInQuickAccess` [`true`/`false`]- Make it so recently used files show up in the quick access menu within the left hand side menu of file explorer. I like to to disable this.
- #### network
  - `EnableNetworkDiscovery` [`true`/`false`] - enables network discovery on all networking interfaces
- #### performance
  - `EnableUltimatePerformance` [`true`/`false`] - unlocks Windows' "Ultimate Performance" power plan setting and enable it. This will give you the abosolute best performance out of your PC.
  - `DisableMonitorTimeout` [`true`/`false`] - prevents windows from turning off your display after a period of inactivity
  - `MonitorTimeout` [`1-9999`] - If `DisableMonitorTimeout` is set to `false`; this will set the number of minutes before your display will turn itself off due to inactivity.
  - `DisableSleep` [`true`/`false`] - prevents windows from putting your computer into sleep/hybernation after a certain period of inactivity. In my experience sleep can break a lot of things, after which I'm required to reboot. I much prefer that my computer simply never enters a hybernated state.
  - `StandbyTimeout` [`1-9999`] - If `DisableSleep` is set to `false`; this will set the number of minutes before you computer will enter sleep/hybernation due to inactivity.
  - `DisableUsbSelectiveSuspend` [`true`/`false`] - prevents windows from powering down usb connected devices after a certain amount of inactivity. USB Selective Suspend can really mess with audio interfaces and other USB devices, I highly recommend you sest this to `true` to disable it.
- #### services
  - `DisableTelemetry` [`true`/`false`] - Disables telemetry within Windows. Telemetry is the process of Microsoft collecting data from your pc, diagnostic and what have you. I'd recommend setting this to `true` for the most part, you don't need to send your data to Microsoft in most cases. Should marginally increase performance and network usage.
- #### start menu
  - `ShowMorePins` [`true`/`false`] - Allows for more pinned apps in the start menu as opposed to more recommendations. People sleep on the new start menu, apps that you use frequently that aren't already pinned to your taskbar should be pinned to your start menu. You also get pin folders for good orgnaiztion capabilities.
  - `ShowRecentlyAddedApps` [`true`/`false`] - Will momentarily disable recently installed apps within the recommendations section of the start menu. I like this, it's useful for quickly accessing and or pinning newly installed apps.
  - `ShowMostUsedApps` [`true`/`false`] - shows most used apps within the recommendations section of the start menu
  - `ShowRecentlyOpenedItems` [`true`/`false`] - shows recently opened files within the recommendations section of the start menu
  - `ShowRecommendations` [`true`/`false`] - shows algorithmically generated file/app recommendations within the recommendations section of the start menu
- #### task bar
  - `ShowTaskbarOnAllDisplays` [`true`/`false`] - shows task bar on all connected displays
  - `CenterAlignTaskbarItems` [`true`/`false`] - Center aligns task bar items. Preferable to left alignment as your mouse is always closer to what you have pinned on the taskbar.
  - `ShowSearch` [`true`/`false`] - Displays a search box on your task bar. Feels redundant to me as you can just open the start menu and start typing to search. Easiest by simply pressing the Windows key and then typing.
  - `SearchStyle` [`1-3`] - If `ShowSearchOnTaskBar` is set to `true`, this will determine what style your search bar will display as (1=compact | 2=search icon + label + box icon | 3=search icon + label).
  - `ShowTaskViewButton` [`true`/`false`] - shows the taskview button on task bar
  - `ShowWidgetsButton` [`true`/`false`] - shows the widget button on task bar
  - `ShowChatButton` [`true`/`false`] - shows the chat button on your (through Microsoft Teams)
  - `ShowSecondsOnClock`- displays seconds on your system clock
